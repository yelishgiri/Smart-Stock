# Smart Stock

## Project Background
Smart Stock is a user-friendly, real-time inventory management application designed for small businesses, especially those in regions where inventory is still tracked manually using outdated methods like paper logs or spreadsheets. These traditional methods are inefficient, prone to human error, and lack real-time data accessibility.

Smart Stock aims to solve these problems by offering:
- Secure authentication
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Barcode Insertion
- And more

Developed using .NET MAUI, C# and SQLite Database Smart Stock is both technically robust and accessible to non-technical users, empowering small business owners to make better, data-driven decisions while minimizing administrative overhead.
